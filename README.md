# Machine-Learning-Projects
Projects done over the course of Spring 2018 for a Machine Learning class. These projects were all placed on GitHub after the due date to prevent other students from copying my code.

Each project was developed using the Pycharm IDE and each project folder includes all files necessary to create a working project folder.
